# Intro

Caching - is one of the best techniques to optimize the API, it uses temporary data storage to cache data









#### When

*   If the system is receiving the same request and needs to use resource that producing the same response for those requests, if business logic allows, it might be a good optimization to **store that response temporarily**, and return without processing anything, thus saving resources

> Example - from technical perspective graphical computing got really advanced nowadays, and it can really optimize resource usage based on activity of the content being rendered, for example, **when gaming** it uses all resources to maximize smoothness, and when rendering **static content** it reduces processes to save resources, so while the **same amount of requests** being received to render the image, it won't, and just return the **previous rendered image**  &#x20;
