# Data Structures



<img src=".gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (1).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

#### When

* literally everywhere, where data is processed

#### What

* way to organize and store data in memory
* logically combines related data&#x20;

#### Types of data structures

Data Structure templates

* class - blueprint for creating objects
* record - easier model template than classes
* struct - lightweight version of class
* enum - a set of named constants
* tuple - lightweight data structure that holds fixed number of elements with different types
* event - communication mechanism between objects
* pointer - direct manipulation off memory addresses
* interface - contract that classes can implement
* delegate - references to the methods



Exact Data Structures - exact implementation or interface, all built-in and custom types



#### Why

* efficiency - optimized data access, storage and manipulation
* organization - structured way to organize data
* search and retrieval - data structures like array, list, stack, queue etc. enables quick search
* memory management - automatic memory allocation and management
* abstraction - built-in data structures have all logic built-in, abstracted for developers

#### How

* use built-in types a.k.a. exact data structures
* define custom types using data structure templates
