# Class

{% hint style="info" %}
Imagine you have multiple data for the same object across multiple arrays or just variables. Wouldn't it be nice to have them logically combined&#x20;

When: The topic of "class" is typically introduced in the early stages of learning object-oriented programming (OOP) in the Web 2.0 curriculum. It serves as one of the fundamental building blocks of OOP and lays the foundation for understanding object-oriented concepts.

Why: Classes are essential in OOP because they provide a blueprint or template for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for code reusability and modularity. Classes enable the creation of multiple instances (objects) with similar characteristics, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.

What: A class is a user-defined data type that defines a blueprint for creating objects. It consists of data members (attributes or fields) and member functions (methods). The data members represent the state or characteristics of the object, while the member functions define the behavior or actions that the object can perform.

How: To create a class in C# (or other OOP languages), you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and curly braces. Inside the class body, you declare the data members and member functions.
